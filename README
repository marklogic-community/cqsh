ABOUT

cqsh is a command line interface for Mark Logic. cqsh was built to be an
alternative to the web interface cq that comes with Mark Logic. It has Readline 
capabilities and allows you to issue queries, load files, and interact with Mark
Logic from a shell environment. cqsh can also be run in batch mode by reading
from stdin or passing in a file path using the -f flag.

INSTALL

cqsh requires Java version 1.4.2 or greater. To build the sources you will also
need ant installed.

Windows:

    COMING SOON

Linux, Mac OS X:

    Unzip the distribution to the location of your choice (/usr/local) and
    optionally set up your path:
        $ export CQSH_HOME=/usr/local/cqsh-version
        $ export PATH=$CQSH_HOME/bin:$PATH


To run cqsh you must specify the user, password, host, and port of your Mark
Logic server. You can provide these on the command line (see: cqsh --help) or
you can create a '.cqshrc' file in your $HOME directory. An example of this file
can be found in the docs/ directory.

Now you can run:
    $ cqsh -u user -p pass -H my.host.com -P 8003

    or if you created a .cqshrc

    $ cqsh

Once your in the cqsh shell you can type:
    cqsh> help

This will print out a list of commands that can be run inside the shell. cqsh
will run XQuery statements and return the results unless a command is issued.
You must terminate your XQuery statements with a ';'.

EXAMPLES

    issue an xquery statement:
        cqsh> for $i in input() return base-uri($i);

    scroll large output 30 lines at a time:
        cqsh> set scroll = 30
        cqsh> (//node)[1 to 10];

    multi-line xquery: 
        cqsh> count(
           ->    for $i in input() return $i
           ->  );

    load a file into the database:
        cqsh> load /home/user/my_file.xml

    run in batch mode from the shell (bash):
        $ cqsh < myquery.xqy

        or

        $ cqsh -f myquery.xqy
        
CUSTOM COMMANDS

You can write your own custom commands by implementing the Command interface.
For an examples check out a few commands in the src/ directory. (Note: the
Environment and Command interfaces are not yet stable and may change in future
releases of the cqsh).
